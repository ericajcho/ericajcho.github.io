								Hi there! I’m Erica, nice to meet you! I am currently a sophomore at UC Berkeley pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Applied Mathematics and Data Science— exciting!

								A little bit about me-- I was born and raised in Los Angeles, but coming up to Cal has been some of the best years of my life! At Berkeley, I am involved at the Social Sciences Data Lab as a UTech staff lead as well as a communications lead. I am also the marketing director for Data Science Society. I hope to become more involved in some areas of humanities as well as art classes and extracurriculars in the future!

								In my spare time, I am often making reckless, spontaneous decisions for adventures (with some degree of responsibility), having quality talks and walks during golden hour, dabbling in photography, or jamming out to some sick tunes on Spotify. Check out my contact page if you'd like to talk more!
