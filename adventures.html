							I have always wanted to explore as much of the world as I could. During my college career, I've had the freedom to be able to be as spontaneous (with some level of responsibility) and visit a lot of cool, beautiful places. Here is a kind of photo blog of the adventures I've been up to!

						<a id="writing">  On Saturday, November 18th, a group of friends whom I met my freshman year, and I went to the Museum of Ice Cream together. It was towards the end of the semester of Fall 2017, so it was nice to get out of Berkeley and have fun for a bit before finals began.</a>
						</div>

						<div class="p">
						<a id="writing">  We took Bart to San Francisco and went shopping for a bit before it was our time to go into the Museum of Ice Cream. There weren't too many people there, as it wasn't a very busy time of the year. It felt as if the museum was ours, and we spent the day laughing and taking pictures in every room with everything, as if the museum was our playground.</a>
						</div>	

						<div class="p">
						<a id="writing"> As cheesy as it may sound, this day was truly a much needed day, especially in the midst of all the work and stress that Berkeley may tend to exude (although this trip may have contributed to the pile of work and responsibilities I had waiting for me). I am blessed to have friends who know how to have a good time, and know how to take fun pictures :')' </a>

						<a id="writing"> This day was truly a day to remember. Not because we did so many exciting, once-in-a-lifetime, AMAZING activities, but because it was a thoughtful, relaxing, yet productive day, and I look back to this day very fondly and with much gratitude and warmth.</a>
						</div>

						<div class="p">
						<a id="writing"> This day, Saturday, March 24th, was actually the first Saturday of spring break of Spring 2018. I had to study for a midterm that was scheduled to be on the Monday after spring break ended (I know, how cruel), and my good friend Andrew suggested that we study together, but somewhere outside of Berkeley, somewhere nice and cozy but would allow us to be focused and productive. So we drove over at 8AM in the morning to San Francisco to a little cafe called Coffee Bar.</a>
						</div>	

						<div class="p">
						<a id="writing"> We spent the whole day studying and working there until late afternoon, when our other good friend, Megan, joined us. We then drove over to La Taqueria to get burritos. Once we ordered, we spontaneously decided that it would be nice to eat our burritos at Dolores Park, so we drove over and sat on the grass in the sun and had sort of a mini picnic. The burrito was actually probably one of the best burritos I have ever eaten, or as Andrew put it, "It was absolutely beautiful, like a nuanced sort of beautiful. The taco was the finesse, like the piece de resistance, while the burrito was like the comfort food to take you down the rest of the culinary journey."</a>
						</div>	

						<div class="p">
						<a id="writing"> After we finished eating, we were going to go home, but something told us that the day was too good to end. We decided we wanted to see the view from Battery Spencer, a spot that overlooks the Golden Gate Bridge. We drove another 30 minutes to get there, just to see the nice view, which was one of the highlights of the trip for me. Though the day was ending, I felt very fulfilled to have been able to spend a productive, yet fun and nature-filled day with two of my good friends.</a>

						<a id="writing">This ski trip took place just the next day after the previous San Francisco trip. It was our spring break trip in which we decided to go skiing at South Lake Tahoe. For me it was my first time skiing while the rest of the group, Christine, Denny, and Andrew, had some degree of experience skiing previously.</a>
						</div>

						<div class="p">
						<a id="writing">We first drove through Sacramento, taking turns driving. I was the youngest of the group, so I was surprised when they let me drive for more than half of the trip, especially in a four-wheel drive Jeep, which I had never driven before. We walked around Sacramento, taking pictures, being typical tourists, and had lunch before heading towards our Airbnb at South Lake Tahoe.</a>
						</div>	

						<div class="p">
						<a id="writing"> The best part of this trip was that whenever we drove past some nice scenery, we would just stop by the side of the road and explore. I really enjoyed this style of traveling because I feel like we really siezed the day throughout the trip. Skiing was also quite the experience-- I got a black eye from falling on my face, but I'm alive!. It was a very worthwhile trip and I am blessed to have this experience and memory to look back on.</a>
